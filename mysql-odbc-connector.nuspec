<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <description>The MySQL Connector/ODBC is the name for the family of MySQL ODBC drivers (previously called MyODBC drivers) 
that provide access to a MySQL database using the industry standard Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API.

MySQL Connector/ODBC provides both driver-manager based and native interfaces to the MySQL database, with full support for MySQL functionality, 
including stored procedures, transactions and, with Connector/ODBC 5.1 and higher, full Unicode compliance.

For more information on the ODBC API standard and how to use it, refer to http://support.microsoft.com/kb/110093.

The application development section of the ODBC API reference assumes a good working knowledge of C, general DBMS, and a familiarity with MySQL. 
For more information about MySQL functionality and its syntax, refer to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/.

Typically, you need to install Connector/ODBC only on Windows machines. For Unix and macOS, you can use the native MySQL network or named pipes 
to communicate with your MySQL database. You may need Connector/ODBC for Unix or macOS if you have an application that requires an ODBC interface 
to communicate with the database. Applications that require ODBC to communicate with MySQL include ColdFusion, Microsoft Office, and Filemaker Pro. </description>
